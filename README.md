# About
OPENBLOX has been replaced with ob-framework. This engine can simulate 2015E (for now. after 2015E is done, expect WAY more time periods)

# How do I use this?
Go to the Examples folder for more information.

To change FFlags, go to Framework -> Global -> ReplicatedStorage -> OB_Services -> GlobalSettings. You'll see them there. Same process with admins, but you have to scroll down. There are other settings, too.
