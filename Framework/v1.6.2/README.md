# New in v1.6.2

Added the old speedometer for 2015E and below.

Fixed the bug with the 2015E player list where ExpandFrame would be inside of the player list. (please roblox why do so many fixes rely on arbitrary waits)

Fix the mouse thinking that it's hovering over something with HurtOverlay and BackupMouse. (2016 Developer Console)

Updated CoreScripts/FakeMouse to use a table for blacklists instead of "if and" statements. (why didn't i do this earlier? idk)
